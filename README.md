# EEE-754 32-bit Floating Point Multiplier

Numerous algorithms were explored in ARM 7 Assembly that multiply two EEE-754 32-bit float numbers. Those included Booth’s, Peasant’s and grade-school multiplication algorithms of which the grade-school multiplication turned out to be the most efficient in terms of function calls.

## Side note

This project was done during the Christmas 2016, but was only commited now with files for other algorithms lost :(
